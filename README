This is my c script (I'm not sure if you call it a script, maybe its a file).
I made it to compare hashes generated from sha256sum, but it works for any string smaller than 100000 which is what I set the array to, so for people who love their strings ove 100000 thats too bad
A match in strings generates a zero, a mismatch will generate another number. Just check out strcmp(), it's real cool. It should then wait for 10 seconds so you can see the value, you should probably change that.
